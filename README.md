# Wordle on Twitch

A wordle-like game that reads Twitch chat for guesses and gives points. 

Add https://wordle-on-twitch.vercel.app/?channel=*YourChannelName* as a browser source in your streaming application. Recommended size is 1920x1080 and downsize to fit your layout.

Note that the game is not synchronized across instances, so the only meaningful way to play is for the streamer to load in the game as a browser source or share their screen to play. Giving the URL to people in chat will not show them the same game as the streamer.
