# Wordle on Twitch

A wordle-like game that reads Twitch chat for guesses and gives points. Available at [https://wordle-on-twitch.vercel.app](https://wordle-on-twitch.vercel.app).
(You can also put your channel name as a "channel" parameter in the url, i.e. https://wordle-on-twitch.vercel.app/?channel=YourChannelName to skip the starting screen)
Note that the game is not synchronized across instances, so the only meaningful way to play is for the streamer to load in the game as a browser source or share their screen to play. Giving the URL to people in chat will not show them the same game as the streamer.
